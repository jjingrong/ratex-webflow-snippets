### Usage

Use the 'raw-source', but with `https://cdn.rawgit.com/`

e.g. 
```
https://cdn.rawgit.com/rate-engineering/ratex-webflow-snippets/master/deals-modal.js
```

Note: If there's multiple commits, do use the correct commit tag as `cdn.rawgit` will not listen to changes, and will cache only the first copy
